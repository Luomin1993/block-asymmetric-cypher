The World War II Lecture Institute was founded in Abington, Pennsylvania in 1997 with the intent of having our nations' World War II veterans share their stories with the public to preserve their generations' legacy. We are currently serving the Philadelphia area with our three lecture programs in Abington, Doylestown and Hershey. 
We are looking to expand to Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and Washington D.C. within the next year. Our programs are run by volunteers and all of are lectures are free and open to the public. Available on our website are the oral histories of our past guest speakers. Our "Veterans in the Classroom" program brings World War II veterans to elementary, middle schools and high schools to help educate future generations. 
Our "Holocaust Oral History Project" helps document the oral histories of Holocaust Survivors. Our "Homefront History Project" helps to documents what life was like on the homefront during World War II. Through our partnership with the Library of Congress - Veterans History Project we are able to place our lectures in the Library of Congress and spread our program nationwide.
